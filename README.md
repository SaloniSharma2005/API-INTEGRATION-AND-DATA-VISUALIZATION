# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION
COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
NAME: SALONI SHARMa
INTERN ID: CT04DZ647 
DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING 
DURATION: 4 WEEKS 
MENTOR: Neela Santhosh Kumar

 Objective

The primary goal of Task 1 is to develop a Python-based solution that integrates with a public API to fetch real-time or structured data, and then visualize that data using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn. This task is designed to help interns understand how to work with external data sources, process dynamic information, and present insights through visual dashboards. A suggested example is using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather forecast data and display temperature trends over time.

Tools and Technologies

To complete this task effectively, the following tools and libraries are recommended:

Python: The core programming language used for scripting and data handling.
Requests: A Python library used to send HTTP requests and interact with APIs.
JSON: The format in which most APIs return data; Python’s built-in `json` module or `response.json()` method is used to parse it.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Visualization libraries used to create graphs, charts, and dashboards.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used to structure and analyze the data before visualization.

 Task Workflow

The task can be broken down into several key steps:

1. API Selection and Access:
   - Choose a public API such as OpenWeatherMap, CoinGecko, NewsAPI, or any other relevant source.
   - Register and obtain an API key if required.
   - Understand the API documentation to identify endpoints, parameters, and response formats.

2. Data Retrieval:
   - Use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the API.
   - Handle the response and parse the JSON data.
   - Extract relevant fields such as timestamps, temperature, humidity, or any other metric depending on the API.

3. Data Structuring:
   - Convert the extracted data into a structured format using Pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform any necessary data cleaning, such as handling missing values or converting timestamps.

4. Visualization:
   - Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visual representations of the data.
   - Common visualizations include:
     - Line charts for time-series data (e.g., temperature over time)
     - Bar charts for categorical comparisons
     - Scatter plots for correlation analysis
   - Customize the chart with titles, axis labels, legends, and color schemes to enhance readability.

5. Dashboard Creation (Optional):
   - Combine multiple charts into a single dashboard layout.
   - Save the visualizations as image files or display them interactively using Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit.

Deliverables

- A fully functional Python script that:
  - Connects to a public API
  - Fetches and processes data
  - Generates one or more visualizations
- A visual dashboard (static or interactive) showcasing the insights
- Optional: A README file explaining the script, API used, and how to run the project

 Learning Outcomes

By completing this task, interns will gain practical experience in:

- Working with real-world APIs and understanding HTTP protocols
- Parsing and manipulating JSON data
- Structuring data for analysis using Pandas
- Designing clear and informative visualizations
- Communicating insights through graphical representation

These skills are foundational for careers in data science, analytics, software development, and automation. API integration is a critical component of modern applications, and data visualization is essential for decision-making and reporting.

 Real-World Applications

This task mirrors real-world scenarios such as:

- Building weather dashboards for travel apps
- Creating financial trend charts from stock market APIs
- Visualizing COVID-19 statistics from health APIs
- Monitoring server performance or IoT sensor data

 Final Notes

Task 1 is not just a coding exercise—it’s a gateway into dynamic data-driven development. It teaches you how to interact with external systems, transform raw data into meaningful insights, and present those insights in a visually compelling manner. Whether you’re building a simple weather app or a complex analytics dashboard, the principles learned here will serve you across countless domains.
